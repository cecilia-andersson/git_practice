		Hi! I'm Ceci, and I see things. If you're here, you're probably me, because this website isn't live yet.
				<br>
				<br>
		 Growing up in southern California, the word <em>hike</em> paired in my mind with <em>hot</em>, <em>exhausting</em>, and <em>dull</em>. It took a few years of introducing myself to New England forests, rivers, and lakes before I fell in love with spending time outdoors. Now, most of my free time is spent fantasizing about the next mountain to climb, lake to bathe in, river to paddle. And expensive gear to buy. But, as a lover of purchases that are green (and account balances in the black), I'm <a id="sustainability page link">working on that</a>.

			<p>Here, you'll find tips on quickly finding unique things to do in places you know nothing about. Since even the most robust itineraries can't predict missed connections, stolen wallets, and hotel booking mistakes, it's good to know how to adapt your plans without losing your peace. I'll even share some of my proudest plans (and mistakes)!

			<p>My favorite (only?) $700 impulse buy: my inflatable kayak. <!--tear smiley face --> I've loved giving my feet a break to explore some water trails this summer, and am excited to share my favorite ways to find water-accessible campsites and day trips (even when in a slow-mover, like my leisure 'yak).

   		 	<h2>Trail Recipes</h2>

			<p>It is a tragedy that food tastes the best after a long hike, but the lightweight meals you can carry backpacking are usually... lacking. As I'm spending more time far from fridges and multi-burner stoves, I'm perfecting some yummy recipes with a variety of ingredient weights and cooking tool requirements<!-- , and <a> my very subjective rating of how energized I felt after the meal</a> -->.
